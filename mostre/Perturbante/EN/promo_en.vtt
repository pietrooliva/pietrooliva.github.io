00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.500
Ah! You've come this far… But fear not…  
the evil that afflicts you is not in the body… it's in the spirit!

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:14.000
Come, restless seekers…  
Enter my workshop of the soul!

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Here, among lead powders, arcane symbols and talking plants,  
I will reveal the secrets of madness, alchemy, and magic…

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:31.000
The troubled minds? They were not sick… but possessed!

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Exorcisms, planetary influences, beastly physiognomies… ah!  
Every face hides a demon, every dream a portent!

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:55.000
And all this… you will find in the exhibition:  
"The Uncanny: madness, exorcisms, witchcraft, magic and alchemy  
in the ancient collections of the Biblioteca Angelica."

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Hurry! Grimoires do not wait…  
nor do spirits!

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Heh heh…
